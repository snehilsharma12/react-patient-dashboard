### Patient Dashboard, React App

I was given a design template for this page for a take-home assessment. I was ghosted with no follow-up. But hey, it was a fun exercise and I learnt a lot.

- Built with React
- Utilized ChartJS for displaying blood pressure graph.
- You can access details of every patient. (this wasn't a requirement but I did it anyway.)
- Component based structure for modular development.
- Global Styles to comply with design template.
- Utilized map to store and access patient data from API response.
